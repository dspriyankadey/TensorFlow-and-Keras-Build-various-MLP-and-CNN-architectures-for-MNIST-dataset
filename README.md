### Objective
<ul><li>
Dense layer with different numbers of neurons, dropouts, and batch normalization.
<li>CNN layer with the different numbers of filters, dropouts and bach normalizations.
<li> CNN layer with different architectures and different number of layers as well.
<li> Comapare different architecture.  
<li> Get accuracy >= 80% .
